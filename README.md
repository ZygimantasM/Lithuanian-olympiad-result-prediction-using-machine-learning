# Lithuanian Educational Olympiad Results Prediction

This project aims to predict the results of Lithuanian educational olympiads using machine learning models. The project includes data analysis and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

## Project Structure


- `olimpiada.csv`: The dataset containing information about the participants and results of various Lithuanian educational olympiads.
- `olimpiada.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, feature engineering, and model training code.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook olimpiada.ipynb
    ```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- optuna
- xgboost
- scikit-learn
- category_encoders

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
